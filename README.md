# AutoController by brianuuuSonic
Based on the LUFA library's Low-Level Joystick Demo (C) Dean Camera
Based on the HORI's Pokken Tournament Pro Pad design (C) HORI

Since System Update v3.0.0, the Nintendo Switch recognizes the Pokken Tournament Pro Pad as a Pro Controller. Physical design limitations prevent the Pokken Controller from functioning at the same level as the Pro Controller. However, by default most of the descriptors are there, with the exception of Home and Capture. Descriptor modification allows us to unlock these buttons for our use.

This project implements a modified version of HORI's Pokken Tournament Pro Pad USB descriptors to allow for the creation of custom controllers for the Nintendo Switch.
